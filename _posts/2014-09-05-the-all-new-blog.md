I always liked the idea of having a blog. The fact was I wanted it to be so much simple and I could never find something that way anywhere till today that I found [Poole](http://getpoole.com).<br>

The fact about Poole is that it somehow shares the very same attitude and culture as the Steve Jobs and good old days of Apple shared. The fonts, Simplicity, Gray color and blue links. So much whitespace and white background.<br>

In the other hand it's on GitHub. You edit the website in Markdown and then you share it via GitHub the very nice tool I use everyday and I fill so cool about it.
