title: The Wonder World of 10 PRINT
---

I have a CASIO Prizm fx-CG10 calculator. It's the most powerful calculator available but it's still very slow as each time you type an equation to render a graph with, you see it takes seconds to render. I bought the calculator because I wanted to write programs for it, on it. So it offers an interpreted scripting language called CASIO-BASIC and I have to say that I love it because I can program anywhere with my calculator but the system is still a calculator so the language is not that rich and it's slow. Slow that much so you see how each line of your software execute. <br>

This calculator thing is somehow the most awesome programming experience I always had. You see it is a tiny language with a command line like screen in size of 7 in 21 characters! It feels like your programming one of those good old DOS systems.<br>

Writing command line interfaces withtout any extra library is what I like so much. You learn who to draw things with only characters and you write so much pretty code for that.<br>

There is a book with a BASIC code name as [10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10](http://10print.org/). The book is written by group of 10 awesome authors. and it's about it's one line title code. The book explores the culture and the way of this one line, How this code happens to be a maze making system.<br>

Before the book I had written the code in many different shapes and a few more better shapes. But after the book I felt like writing some complex codes to create modern codes for rendering the character like graphic in 10PRINT. <br>

As I'm developing my own language [Arendelle](http://web.arendelle.org) the first code I wrote was an Arendelle one as you see in the beginning of this code. You can find it in [GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/10print). I'm going to write [Processing](http://processing.org) codes for much better ones. <br>

By adding two colors to my code you can easily understand why by writing only slash and backslah characters you'll get a maze.
