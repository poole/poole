title: Should I use proprietary software?
---

There is a common culture, a share attitude behind Free Software developers and it's about using non-free software which is called Proprietary. True free software developers (And in this case non of the open source developers) are like soldiers. More than the fact that they are developers and they must write software they are fighting for computing freedoms.

They work hard to keep the web open and free. They work like a team some times even without knowing each other to create huge software as replacements for those proprietary ones.

What they believe is that using this non-free applications are so much forbidden. They believe that we must never buy any of them so the proprietary developers be stopped and for many years I tried so much to stick to this motto.

I had my own reasons. I wanted my system to be open source so I could see how it operates and learn by that; As a developer I must say open source applications are the best resources for learning. Also the fact that you can modify the software you use is magnificent for example I use [NCalc](http://ncalc.codeplex.com) for my mathematical computations like when you write =223x34 in Nexear's calculator it's NCalc that calculates it for you at last. Now when I found this tool I felt like there is something missing, I wanted some extra functions and also there were this rule that it's function names must start with capital case characters (So `Foo` is right and `foo` is forbidden.); If it was something non-free I had to accept my boundaries and give up or waste years of my life to write the whole system from scratch so then I add my little functions to it but NCalc is a free software. Long time ago I downloaded it's source codes, made my changes and now it works exactly how I want.

One other example is my operating system. I have used more than [60 different](http://kary.us/lists/operating-systems) and then I ended up with Ubuntu. When you use it you know that it's the right place to be. I have experienced many developer situations and only Ubuntu is good in all of them. More than a perfect design and magnificent tools that you find in no other system you see how being a free software has made Ubuntu a hero. You see that you are able to do what ever your heart desired without being stopped. You can customize everything at any time by just changing some codes. It's too simple and fun. For example think if you don't like the look and feel of your Windows desktop; What you do...? Oh you do nothing! There is no way you can use another desktop! But in Ubuntu you can use GNOME Shell, Unity, KDE, LXDE.... or you can change what ever you want about their looks and functions also you are most welcome to develop your own desktop just for your needs...

In the other side there are people who believe that free software hackers are stupid (we are not!)
