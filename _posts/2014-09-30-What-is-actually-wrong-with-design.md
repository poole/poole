title: What is wrong with design?
---

When I was 3 or 4 years old my aunt gave me my first LEGO set. It was one of those fun and awesome old western ones. That LEGO changed my whole life in many so many ways. The first thing was I loved the whole idea of it and I spent about 12 years after playing only with LEGO and I had no interest in anything else. LEGO made my mind think environmental I mean to do anything I need to create an environment and bricks then use them to build what I want and thats why I’m so interested on programming because it shares just the same idea. But the other thing LEGO taught me was the definition of true beauty. You could sit and look at it’s bricks for such a long time. They were beautiful and classy, they were designed so perfect that they could merge and connect togather in many different ways and at last LEGO had and still has the greatest polymer formula for creating it’s plastics so they were the highest quality they could ever be. LEGO bricks were “Perfection” and I always look at myself so lucky that in such age I could see the perfection and understand  it. I owe LEGO so much for that.<br>

A true Perfection is something so much rare and in my whole life  to find stuff so perfect that you perfect that nothing makes them better.<br>

Steve Jobs was my only hero so far. He’s the only man who I know and I feel I understand more than anyone. I love the way he looked at things, I love the way he could see the design and everything about. I can feel just like the way Jobs could feel. <br>

And feeling him makes me sure that if he we’re here he would be so angry of the new iOS and Mac designs. I mean when you stare at a mac you know there is nothing more beautiful than that. You know, the skeuomorphism design behind the apple, the fact that when you opened the Garage Band for example, you could see the woods and Jeans around it was magnificent. Colors of all over the system. Buttons, Scroll Bars, Windows everything inside and outside it was beautiful and you could know there is nothing better than that but today when there is the new OS 10, Yosemite coming I don’t know if that’s what I want. People around the world loves it.<br>

The new design is of course much cleaner than the old one but it lacked beauty. You can’t look at it like the way you look at the other things. All the lovely icons you loved for so long are about to die with Mavericks and all the beautiful Menu bar, The awesome Gill Sans menus and magnificent windows, You will no longer see them. I feel if Jobs was still alive we could see so much more and better things from the Apple.<br>

I feel like I’m keeping my Mavericks system for ever and I may only install the new versions beside it so I can use the new apps but this system, this system is all I wanted that I’m not ready to simply lose it.<br>

I loved this system because of its design. Once the design is gone why should I even have it? I think this is why people can’t have an awesome life because nothing is enough for them. They want perfection when they have it but they always want more. This is the human nature, our beauty and ugly at the same time.
