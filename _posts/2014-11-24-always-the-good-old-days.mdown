This is a very historical picture to me. Well, When I was really younger, maybe 13 or something I discovered the cool nature of why a computer is something fun and then I started to create things with it. One of the really first things I created was a font called “PA-Comic No.1”. This font changed everything as it was the whole reason why I made a BaseKit website which is why I won the best BaseKit design for two years, a year later and then also the reason Why I created Pouya Animation: A little website I made to share my work (And you can find a historical one-page simulation of it [here](http://thepa.kary.us) ) Then soon it transferred into something far different: a place where I shared the software I wrote back to that days, So you see I love this font even when designers makes fun of it. Creation of this font was something fun. I created each character using Adobe Ideas on my iPod Touch and then I imported each of them into FontLab and then I had my very own font which I loved so much. This fun end actually is not one of those happy ends because today I just realized that somehow I’ve lost the font and every file related to it. All the backups… everything is gone. So if you have any copy please please please send me the files. That would make me the happiest man on Earth. You know my [main](mailto:k@arendelle.org) right?
