* Super girl is 28 month old now. I have no doublt that she is a smart and happy girl. I have never seen any individual like her. She looks like me, but she is also so different. 


### language 

She can communicate all her needs, precisely and clearly. She know names of a lot of things. 

She can recite many poem. She can sing a lot of song. 

She can count from one to .....perhaps more than 30. 

However, she does not seem to be able to create sentences. She can recite an entire book. But she rarely speak long sentences. If I insisted on she saying long sentences with me. She gets unhappy. 

### social ability

She is in generally social. But she is sensitive. If people laugh, she would cry.
