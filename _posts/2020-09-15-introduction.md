title: The Goal of Understanding Everything

I've been quite interested for a while in understanding everything. More specifically with settling the question: "What's up with reality?". Now I'm at a point where it seems like it might be helpful to write some ideas down, so I created this blog as an outlet. I have a vague hope that this could be in some way also beneficial for AI safety, but it's not the immediate goal here, and I'm OK if that doesn't happen.
