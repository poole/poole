title: There is something to say
---
I'm sitting behind my computer. I have just received a bad news about my future. It's somehow hard to tell what this news is but there is this very fact that I need to share my feelings even if there is to actual person who may reads it. I have experienced strange feelings. As far as I can tell I never felt like this before. This note that I'm writing is somehow a bit wired and also a bit I don't know. Once I saw a movie about a couple willing to fix their relationship so they visit one of those marriage consultants and that guy forces them to review their personalities by talking to their subconsciousness. And to let their mind talk instead of them. Now I'm experiencing something like this. Like what I'm writing is not me. There are parts that I even don't believe so it must be it. However this is so much and very much nice to write. You feel lighter and at last someone better even if what you're writing not makes any sense. You just write... because well there is all ways something to say
