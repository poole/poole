<!--- Main Blurb --->

I am a consultant at the World Bank. I support data-intensive projects related to trade, policy, and economic development. Recently I’ve contributed to projects about globalization, COVID-19 vaccine supply, and trade in India and Latin America.

Previously, I was a research specialist at the Empirical Studies of Conflict project at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, where I worked on projects related to COVID-19 misinformation and understanding influence operations. 

I have a MA in Economics (2019), focusing on Development Studies, and a BA in Economics and Geography (2018) from McGill University.  I am trained in econometrics and GIS, and mostly use R and STATA. I was born in the Philippines and raised in four countries before settling in Canada. 

Across my past and present work, one thing remains certain: a deep interest in data analysis for economic development and communicating findings through simple and effective visualizations and accessible writing. 

Outside of work, I am currently focusing on:
1. Practicing writing, leaning towards a journalistic style 
2. Personal data projects
3. Making a career outside of academia (it’s all I’ve known!)
