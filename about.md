I am a research consultant at the World Bank. I work on various data-intensive projects related to trade and development. My pronouns are he/him. Recently, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects about de-globalization, COVID-19 vaccine supply and demand and the falling price of cement in Africa.

Previously, I was a research specialist at the Empirical Studies of Conflict lab at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. During my time there, I worked on projects related to COVID-19 misinformation, collaborative models for understanding influence operations, and impacts of violence on ethnolinguistic communications in Afghanistan.

I have a MA in Economics (2019), focusing on Development Studies, and a BA in Economics and Geography (2018) from McGill University. I am trained in econometrics and GIS, and mostly use R and STATA. 

Across my past and present work, one thing remains certain: a deep interest in analyzing and visualizing novel data to answer research questions.
