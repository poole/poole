I am an interactional linguist and research face-to-face encounters of skilled practitioners who pursue scientific work in collaborative environment. I investigate in particular how they build co-operative action by using talk, gesture, and other embodied actions, within settings, along with tools and other materials. I am interested in how these interactive practices are situated not only in their current contexts, but within the multiple courses of activity. 

I am currently looking at these processes in two ongoing projects: In the training of cardiology fellows during heart biopsies, and in the interaction between novice and senior geologists in fieldwork. In my earlier work I focused on medical interactions involving neurological patients and their caregivers.
