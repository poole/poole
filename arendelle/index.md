# Arendelle Kit
To work with Arendelle I have created some code generators to create some specific things like a texts, random graphics and so... Non of this programs will be here for download before the original release of Arendelle's desktop environments<br>

## Gothi

Have you ever wanted to write a text in Arendelle, like your name? Well, Gothi does it for you. I have created a database of codes for all the basic lating (plain English) letters which Gothi uses to generate you codes that you can use to render your text.<br>

## Arendelle Maker

Well I wanted to create an artwork based on random graphics. I wanted to create random Arendelle blueprints and then using 20 renders of each of them create an artwork. To do so I wrote this tool that generates you a random code in a special format. It uses it's system to create a patterns and then does the pattern in random places. I will never share the code and app but you can find the artwork online to watch
