[Arendelle](http://web.arendelle.org) is my programming language for creating art. Using Arendelle you can build many awesome graphics but here I have just listed a few that I like so much. Some of them are rendered statically. It means they are an sketch but some others are dynamic. These dynamics are programs that each time you run you get a different sketch.
