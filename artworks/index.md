# Artworks
By 'Artwork' I meant 2D images categorized here. I love sketching and drawing cartoons. Something I love so much more is creating graphics and visualizations with computer programming. For that matter I use my own language [Arendelle](http://web.arendelle.org), [Processing](http://processing.org) world's most powerful language for creating 2D/3D graphics and [TouchDevelop](http://touchdevelop.com) a small language developed by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com) that turns out can be good for toy programming. <br>
