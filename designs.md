I love design and sketching but here's the thing: "I don't know anything about it" so I do some hobbies. I love sketching and drawing cartoons. I love making graphics with computers that why I created a [programming language](http://web.arendelle.org) and used [other](http://processing.prg) programming tools to create them. I also love website design and making fonts. I have listed some of the categories of my works here you can take a look. and remember that you'll go into media.kary which is my design gallery.<br>
