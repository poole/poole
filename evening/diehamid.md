# Die Hamid Die!
In the history of humanity there were many famous devils. Satan, Hitler, Kim Jung Un, Vladimir Lenin, Robert Mugabe, FOX Channel's CEO and My school's principal, However there also were not famous evil people so selfish that if you could give them the power, history of human kind would be so doomed.

One of this horrible evil persons is my best friend (BFF/Besty) **Hamid Reza Aslani**. When you talk with him he seems to be a gentleman and in front of people a ferry angle but when it comes to his inner person. He's a devil! Some anonymous sources told me that because he was the one who suggested the idea of Hell god has titled him in "Special Thanks" section of end titles of his biography movie: "Founder of Hell". Some also say because of his great powers in creating new punishments he now holds the title "Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Hell".

He actually is very famous. In some culture there's an old prophecy that states: *someone, a chosen one, a long, short, Sheldon looking fella with talent, power, evil from inside will come that everyone who touches him will suffer so bad that they'll crap their pants and fell the pain in their asses. People will call him * ***Hamid***

Even in the postmodern society you can find speak of Hamid like the way in last years of my school I've heard the principal predicted his arrival by shouting *When does this Aslani comes?!* just like he was "Time Leader" of Islam!

When it comes to how horrible Hamid is I can tell many unfortunate and not accidental events I've seen with my own eyes but as you can't effort to spend rest of your life going to therapy I won't tell them all.However there's one you may get over (In at least your next 20 years of life of course): Once we had this "Going out, Having fun" day and in the way home this evil horrible person made our cab start smoking, fight his wife and tell us every single trashy word he knew. But more sad is what this ruthless tyrant grim remembers of that night and cabbie, is: "One of best days of his life, OMG! The launch was awesome and I saw this panties that was so freaking totally me! Also we made this cabbie guy smoke... LOL dude! You should have seen his face when he was crying like a 4 year old!..." Oh dear! Sorry! My bad! This was what he texted to Satan (Not himself, One of his sidekicks who's running Hell for him so he can rule the Earth and find new souls...). What he actually remember has more "fun" and "cool" adjectives.

I've heard god has a safety deposit because of this cruel unjust wroth. We have a common friend **Armin**. He tells us his a human but I'm sure his son of god or maybe his cousin. Armin is what in different languages and cultures has different names like "Angel", "Ferry","Saint", "Gentleman", "The hairy guy in hangover... No! that less hairy one that U2 wrote a song for him which has no connection to him whatsoever... Why I remember a hairy guy...??" and we simply call him "Armin"

I've seen this psychic, mentally ill, crazy bastard torturing him like a slave and use him as a slave like a slave. I've seen with this two eyes he said "Okay Armin I'll have your phone. Come here and get it by tomorrow!" this little tiny sweet looking damn oppressor incubus bully uses Armin like he owns him as a slave!!

So this was why when you had to choose the devil of the year in Academy Awards, You have to choose "Hamid Reza Aslani" instead of "Simon Cowell", Now if you excuse me I have a meeting in Hell staring horrible Hamid that I have to catch.
