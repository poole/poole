# Information
This is fun to write about yourself! My name is obviously Pouya Kary and I was born in january 8th 1996, When I was two years old I gave my first LEGO set and it took me ten years to do stuff other than playing LEGO and I see that what made me a nerd. LEGO 


# Outside view
There are things happened to me that I like and I’m proud of, there are some of my favorites:

* [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.com) author of [Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language Book](http://createyourproglang.com) (The famous book in programming language design that made Jeremy Ashkenas create CoffeeScript) said about my language Arendelle:

  > Wow! 
  > That is amazing! I love your language. 
  > All of it's samples brought a smile to my face.

* [BaseKit Platform](http://www.basekit.com) one of the worlds biggest and the best online website builder gave me a BASEKIT-ONLY VIP account with unlimited resources after my [website](http://thepa.mx) selected as the best website design for two years.

* [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org) the world greatest Hacker personally sent me two copies of his signatures with to stickers regarding my contribution to the software freedom and GNU Operating System.

* He served as a [GNU Maintainer](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/gnu-spotlight-with-karl-berry-december-2011) for about a year.

* One of my applications “[Kincob](http://thepa.mx/kincob)” is listed in Norton software's virus lists and there are [more websites than you can imagine](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Kincob+0.023+Unstable) for the sake of removing Kincob while the software is not virus but only gives the user full access to the system!

* He's applications KinBoard recived 4.6 / 5 in [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/KinBoard.shtml)
