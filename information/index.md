# Information

> *This text is a short story of my life not my resume! You can find about my [skills](http://kary.us/skills) in it’s own page*

This is fun to write about yourself! My name is obviously Pouya Kary and I was born in January 8th 1996, I love creating things that I want to exist that are mostly programs.<br>

When I was two years old my parents gave me my first LEGO set, at age of five I realized that the only thing that I can do is to create new ideas and new stuff so soon I started to learn the skills I needed<br>

My father is a scientists so he works in a research center and he is head of one of the coolest labs possible, He’s job is like working in NASA, you see giant hight technology devices which most of them are made by my father’s team. Seeing those guys building anything they wanted was amazing. It was just when I understand what I want to do with the rest of my life: I wanted to be an inverter! I wanted to create great looking awesome new things coming with high quality and fresh technology behind them.<br>

Years passed to when I felt in love with computers and well I wanted to become more than a good user in them. I was about 13 when I found my first programming introduction video about Visual Basic, I actually did not understand a word! But the thing was I understood how create a signal and process a button press after that I felt so good that I wanted to create a user interface like the Apple’s iTunes.<br>

I could clone the search text box of Mac just like it is in iTunes, it has that magnifier, fonts were right and when you clicked on it you could see the shinning around it. Creating something exactly like the way Apple did it had a magnificent joy for me as a starter. That joy motivated me to become a developer. Since then I have learned so much and worked with many technologies, I have coded things like a Pebble watch or a CASIO Prizm calculator, operating systems like Haiku and even my own OS to popular desktop platforms like Mac, Ubuntu and Windows.<br>

Actually I did whatever I did just for fun and this simple idea that I wanted to create things I wanted. I never did any of them have a better resume or to prove the fact that I could do and well that’s why I did all of them open source and for free because I love what I do and they are priceless to me.<br>

My journey starts when I found [BaseKit](http://www.basekit.com) 
, A free online solution to create websites. And well after a big of working in it I could create my very own first website and I had this font that I made back to those days, So I uploaded the whole thing into my website and well I was happy about it.<br>

As I felt in love so much with BaseKit I started to create bigger and better things with it and that made me win the best design of BaseKit for almost two years between 1 million BaseKit websites and well more than this awesome feeling that people is watching you and they know that you exist BaseKit gave me a VIP account so I could create 200 free websites, I have 1024TB (Yes! TB!) of space and well unlimited traffic! This is more than a good reward! BaseKit did many good things to me! They were so kind to me, I remember their posts on my Facebook page asking me to “Keep the good job going” that made me have so much self confidence and made me a better developer<br>

One big moment in my life was when I was introduced into Free Software. The 4 rules defined by Richard Stallman that made it clear what free software is and what it looks like.<br>

I moved to Ubuntu to live free, It actually feels like living between hippies. I’m not saying it was like using marijuana and living that way. It was like living in a country with no government and no one in charge, GNU/Linus users were so kind to each other. We had everything we wanted open sourced and for free. Actually the users were even more open minded, They were mostly scientists, super awesome users, social activists. They were more vegetarian, charity activists and they were truly made the idea of a better world possible. Somewhere money means nothing and people pay how much they like for what they get. Somewhere that no one is in charge and everyone helps that where to become somewhere more awesome. <br>

I liked that idea of “Free Software” so much. that’s why I betted into the society and tried to create “Free Software”. This made me become a GNU maintainer. I maintained GNU Gleem for about 6 months and it felt so good for me. I have a @gnu.org mail which made my resume full! Wherever I go, when I say my email is kary@gnu.org everyone looks at me so much different! However my education took all my time so I had to give up Gleem and then I resigned form my position.<br>

Meanwhile I talked to Richard Stallman and once in his birthday I asked him to send me his signature and he actually did! Two months after that moment I received a package of two GNU stickers and two papers of GNU and “Happy Hacking Richard Stallman” on them. that actually made my year!<br>

Something here was the fact that I loved Free Software but there was BaseKit, A proprietary company that gave me anything! In the free software religion you have to only and only use Free Software and hate all the other proprietary stuff. It was a paradox for me. I wanted to have Mac beside my Ubuntu because I’m half designer and I wanted Mac and also I wanted BaseKit. that was the moment when I changed my status from a “Free Software Developer” to an “Open Source Developer” this way I could enjoy living with both people.<br>

What I know I’m now is a student of computer science who loves design and works that tries to create stuff that makes people more productive, creative and laughing.


# Things I like about myself
There are things happened to me that I like and I’m proud of, there are some of my favorites:

* [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.com) author of [Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language Book](http://createyourproglang.com) (The famous book in programming language design that made Jeremy Ashkenas create CoffeeScript) said about my language Arendelle:

  > Wow! 
  > That is amazing! I love your language. 
  > All of it's samples brought a smile to my face.

* [BaseKit Platform](http://www.basekit.com) one of the worlds biggest and the best online website builder gave me a BASEKIT-ONLY VIP account with unlimited resources after my [website](http://thepa.mx) selected as the best website design for two years.

* [Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org) the world greatest Hacker personally sent me two copies of his signatures with to stickers regarding my contribution to the software freedom and GNU Operating System.

* I served as a [GNU Maintainer](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/gnu-spotlight-with-karl-berry-december-2011) for about a year.

* One of my applications “[Kincob](http://thepa.mx/kincob)” is listed in Norton software's virus lists and there are [more websites than you can imagine](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Kincob+0.023+Unstable) for the sake of removing Kincob while the software is not virus but only gives the user full access to the system!

* My applications KinBoard received 4.6 / 5 in [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/KinBoard.shtml)
