# Showcase
## 2014 Arendelle Language
[Website](http://web.arendelle.org) | [Developer Website](http://developer.arendelle.org) | [GitHub Repositories](http://github.com/arendelle) | [Source Code](http://github.com/arendelle/arendelle) <br>
Arendelle is a domain-specific programming language for creating 16-bit like Pixel art. Arendelle uses a grid system and a pointer for navigating and painting the desired squares of the grid. The grammar behind Arendelle is completely new as it uses only one character for it's commands and grammars. Just like everything else in Arendelle the main engine of the language is based on a new interpreter design invented by Pouya Kary named *Recursive Scanner* rather than the Lexer-Parser-Code-Generator. Using this technique the interpreter actually never generates any code. It reads the code and execute it. Like a byte-code runtime but much more powerful to understand grammars. This way for executing makes the software much more fast and efficient<br><br>

## 2014 Arcade IDE
[Website](http://developer.arendelle.org/technologies/arcade) | [GitHub](http://github.com/arendelle/arendelle)<br>
Arcade IDE is the official cross-platform command line environment for Arendelle Language. It uses command line characters to represent dots (Arendelle grid's cells). Arcade is a fully cross-platform software with hard-coded operating system detection. So it runs natively on any operating system without any need for recompiling.<br><br>

## 2014 Mermaid.DLL
[Website](http://developer.arendelle.org/technologies/mermaid) | [GitHub](http://github.com/arendelle/mermaid) <br>
Mermaid is a .NET library for text and string. It has a set of everyday tools for developers including tools for editing strings, working with HTML tags, language lexing tools and first class Multi-Cell scanners for Arendelle Language.<br><br>

## 2014 Pabbie Language
[Website](http://research.arendelle.org/projects/pabbie) | [GitHub](http://github.com/arendelle/pabbie) <br>
Pabbie is language that compiles into Arendelle using a very simple and light weight source-to-source compiler. Pabbie is aimed to have a syntax and grammar close to everyday human English as a research on human language understanding and bringing programming to the people with no background on programming. The research also aims to bridge 5th generation programming languages and complex machine learning techniques to it's design to develop a language that people use to explain what they need and the system generates applications.<br><br>

## 2014 Chess Knight Path Optimizer
[Website](http://kary.us/projects/knight) | [GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/knight) <br>
A mathematical optimization for generating the optimized path for a Chess Knight to move from button left to the top right of a chess board with any size. The software for this algorithm is written in Arendelle Language and it's the first Arendelle software that processes a given input and generates something. Reading the code will be good for practicing data visualizations in Arendelle<br><br>

## 2013 CODIUM
[GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/codium) <br>
CODIUM is an encoding / decoding method based on prime numbers. It gives each character a prime number alternative and then by multiplying numbers of words it make a number from each word. for decoding by prime factoring the numbers you get the characters and then by running an anagram test you get the decoded version of encoded string<br><br>

## 2013 Equer
[GitHub](http://github.com/pmkary/equer) <br>
One small command-line based super-mini app maker designed to make a Python command line software from a given mathematical equation so you can easily run a tiny app, fill the parameters and give your answer. It comes with about 7 commands that you must use them to build your app.<br><br>

## 2013 TexTHOR
[GitHub](https://github.com/pmkary/TexTHOR) <br>
Prototype of a text editor interface designed for command line which gives you the ability to type commands inside your text that makes it crazy fast and super easy to use. The prototype only comes with functions for clearing the text, storing it ans also commenting inside the text.<br><br>

## 2013 SPACIUM
[Website](http://thepa.mx/fonts/spacium) | [FontStruct](http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/spacium_beta_4) | [Luc Devroye's Blog](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-67205.html)<br>
A typeface designed in the style of sci-fi spaceship fonts. The type is not finished and may face huge changed in the future<br><br>

## 2013 Nexear
[Website](http://thepa.mx/nexear/main) | [GitHub](http://github.com/thepa) <br>
One powerful text editor designed to open and edit more than one file at time. Capable of importing PDF, ePub, DOC, DOCX and ODF to plain text and storing more than one text file in one .nexear file and coming with it's own built in command-line language, calculator, programming features, Arendelle code optimizing and lots of lots of more features<br><br>

## 2013 Mathman
[Website](http://thepa.mx/mathman/home)<br>
Calculation machine with a console based interface and such a powerful engine. Because of the connections that Parallel Architecture had the software uses many private and hide algorithms the software can process math expressions faster than ever. Also the software comes with some applets that never existed in any calculation system before.<br><br>

## 2012 KinBoard
[Website](http://thepa.mx/kinbaord/home) | [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/KinBoard.shtml) <br>
A.K.A Kincob's Board is a virtual black board designed to be a part of Kincob shell but soon became a popular application because of it's fast'n'easy interface. It was also written only for Windows and discontinued so there is only one version available<br><br>

## 2012 Comicfont
[Website](http://thepa.mx/fonts/comicfont)<br>
A typeface designed to be like a child-handwriting but soon changed to a very special kind of typeface and we named Comicfont because it was comic. The font itself designed to be used in some of Parallel Architectures projects but also released as a public-domain font in early 2012<br><br>

## 2012 Plothing
[Website](http://thepa.mx/plothing/home) <br>
Concept of designing a bar-code to be like a pizza. Some prototypes are out but the bar-code recognition system is still under development by Parallel Architectures.<br><br>

## 2012 Textmaster
[TouchDevelop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/hwyo)<br>
Suit of 3 different Windows Phone applications for creating artworks from one input text. This 3 apps were Circler: An application to create a circle from a given text, This web page and Kary's logo is rendered by this software too. Waller: To create a picture from randomized shapes of given input and Starus a template for creating wallpapers. The script once [continued](https://www.touchdevelop.com/onux) by Hans Würstchen that year.<br><br>

## 2012 Kincob
[Website](http://thepa.mx/kincob)<br>
UNIX Shell simulator for Windows platforms with many built in features like web search and calculator. Main point in designing the software was creating an AI based command line tool that understands human language named Semi-Mind core. The project discontinued by Parallel Architectures in 2013<br><br>
